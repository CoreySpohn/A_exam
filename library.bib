abstract = {The vapor pressure above ice is lower than that above supercooled water at the same temperature. This inherent hygroscopic quality of ice has recently been exploited to suppress frost growth by patterning microscopic ice stripes along a surface. These vapor-attracting ice stripes prevented condensation frosting from occurring in the intermediate regions; however, the required presence of the sacrificial ice stripes made it impossible to achieve the ideal case of a completely dry surface. Here, we decouple the sacrificial ice from the antifrosting surface by holding an uncoated aluminum surface in parallel with a prefrosted surface. By replacing the overlapping in-plane dry zones with a uniform out-of-plane dry zone, we show that even an uncoated aluminum surface can stay almost completely dry in chilled and supersaturated conditions. Using a blend of experiments and numerical simulations, we show that the critical separation required to keep the surface dry is a function of the ambient supersaturation.},

We develop a completeness function for Earth-like planets on "habitable" orbits for an instrument with a central field obscuration, uniform sensitivity in an annular detection zone, and limiting sensitivity that is expressed as a "delta magnitude" with respect to the star, determined by systematic effects (given adequate exposure time). We demonstrate our method of estimation by applying it to our understanding of the coronagraphic version of the Terrestrial Planet Finder (TPF-C) mission as of October 2004. We establish an initial relationship between the size, quality, and stability of the instrument's optics and its ability to meet mission science requirements. We provide options for increasing the fidelity and versatility of the models on which our method is based, and we discuss how the method could be extended to model the TPF-C mission as a whole, to verify that its design can meet the science requirements.},

@article{Forecaster,
abstract = {Mass and radius are two of the most fundamental properties of an astronomical object. Increasingly, new planet discoveries are being announced with a measurement of one of these terms, but not both. This has led to a growing need to forecast the missing quantity using the other, especially when predicting the detectability of certain follow-up observations. We present am unbiased forecasting model built upon a probabilistic mass-radius relation conditioned on a sample of 316 well-constrained objects. Our publicly available code, Forecaster, accounts for observational errors, hyper-parameter uncertainties and the intrinsic dispersions observed in the calibration sample. By conditioning our model upon a sample spanning dwarf planets to late-type stars, Forecaster can predict the mass (or radius) from the radius (or mass) for objects covering nine orders-of-magnitude in mass. Classification is naturally performed by our model, which uses four classes we label as Terran worlds, Neptunian worlds, Jovian worlds and stars. Our classification identifies dwarf planets as merely low-mass Terrans (like the Earth), and brown dwarfs as merely high-mass Jovians (like Jupiter). We detect a transition in the mass-radius relation at {\$}2.0{\_}{\{}-0.6{\}}{\^{}}{\{}+0.7{\}} M{\_}\backslashoplus{\$}, which we associate with the divide between solid, Terran worlds and Neptunian worlds. This independent analysis adds further weight to the emerging consensus that rocky Super-Earths represent a narrower region of parameter space than originally thought. Effectively, then, the Earth is the Super-Earth we have been looking for.},

abstract = {Atmospheric characterization of directly imaged planets has thus far been limited to ground-based observations of young, self-luminous, Jovian planets. Near-term space- and ground- based facilities like $\backslash$emph{\{}WFIRST{\}} and ELTs will be able to directly image mature Jovian planets in reflected light, a critical step in support of future facilities that aim to directly image terrestrial planets in reflected light (e.g. HabEx, LUVOIR). These future facilities are considering the use of photometry to classify planets. Here, we investigate the intricacies of using colors to classify gas-giant planets by analyzing a grid of 9,120 theoretical reflected light spectra spread across different metallicities, pressure-temperature profiles, cloud properties, and phase angles. We determine how correlated these planet parameters are with the colors in the $\backslash$emph{\{}WFIRST{\}} photometric bins and other photometric bins proposed in the literature. Then we outline under what conditions giant planet populations can be classified using several supervised multivariate classification algorithms. We find that giant planets imaged in reflected light can be classified by metallicity with an accuracy of {\$}{\textgreater}{\$}90$\backslash${\%} if they are $\backslash$emph{\{}a prior{\}} known to not have significant cloud coverage in the visible part of the atmosphere, and at least 3 filter observations are available. If the presence of clouds is not known $\backslash$emph{\{}a priori{\}}, directly imaged planets can be more accurately classified by their cloud properties, as oppposed to metallicity or temperature. Furthermore, we are able to distinguish between cloudy and cloud-free populations with {\$}{\textgreater}{\$}90$\backslash${\%} accuracy with 3 filter observations. Our statistical pipeline is available on GitHub and can be extended to optimize science yield of future mission concepts.},

We use the TESS Candidate Target List 6 (CTL-6) as an input catalog of over 4 million sources. We predict that from the 200,000 stars selected to be observed with the high-cadence postage stamps with the highest CTL-6 priority, there will be 241 single-transit events caused by planets detectable at a signal-to-noise ratio of SNR{\$}\backslashge7.3{\$}. We find a lower limit of an additional 977 events caused by single-transit planets in the full frame images (FFI); this is a lower limit because the CTL-6 is incomplete below a TESS magnitude of {\$}T{\textgreater}12{\$}. Of the single-transit events from the postage stamps and FFIs, 1091/1218 will have transit depths deeper than 0.1{\%}, and will thus be amenable for photometric follow-up from the ground, and 1195/1218 will have radial velocity signals greater than 1 m/s. We estimate that the periods of 146 single transits will be constrained to better than 10{\%} using the TESS photometry assuming circular orbits. We find that the number of planets detected by TESS in the postage stamps with periods {\$}P{\textgreater}25{\$} days will be doubled by including single-transiting planets, while the number of planets with {\$}P{\textgreater}250{\$} days will be increased by an order of magnitude. We predict 79 habitable zone planets from single-transits, with 18 orbiting FGK stars.},

abstract = {Near-Earth Objects (NEOs) are both scientifically interesting and hazardous to the Earth. The number of these objects larger than 1 km in size is estimated to be from 1500 to 2000, but only 10 to 15 percent of them have been discovered to date. In order to evaluate the threat posed by these objects, we must discover the remaining vast majority of these hazardous objects. At least seven major survey programs have been initiated or are in the planning stages. NASA has made it a goal to help realize the aim of the Spaceguard Survey, which is to discover at least 90 percent of all NEOs with diameters greater than 1 km within 10 years. Physical characterization of NEOs using ground-based photometric, spectral, and radar observations, along with in situ measurements from spacecraft, all contribute to a better understanding of these objects. Orbit characterization is based on optical and radar astrometric observations; this paper outlines some of the orbit determination techniques. The accuracy of the orbit solution depends primarily on the length of the time span over which the object is observed. Radar observations can also dramatically improve the accuracy of an orbit solution. Once an orbit has been computed, future close approaches can be predicted along with their uncertainties. This paper outlines methods for computing the impact probability as a function of close approach uncertainties. No known NEO has any significant chance of impacting the Earth in the next fifty to a hundred years. The report last year suggesting that asteroid 1997 XF11 might hit the Earth in the year 2028 was a false alarm. A complete analysis of the close approach uncertainties shows that an impact in 2028 could be ruled out, even without additional pre-discovery observations. If an object were discovered to be on a collision course with Earth, the warning time could range anywhere from hours to decades, the most important factor being how early the object is discovered.},

abstract = {We model the settlement of the galaxy by space-faring civilizations in order to address issues related to the Fermi Paradox. We explore the problem in a way that avoids assumptions about the intent and motivation of any exo-civilization seeking to settle other planetary systems. We first consider the speed of an advancing settlement via probes of finite velocity and range to determine if the galaxy can become inhabited with space-faring civilizations on timescales shorter than its age. We also include the effect of stellar motions on the long term behavior of the settlement front which adds a diffusive component to its advance. The results of these models demonstrate that the Milky Way can be readily 'filled-in' with settled stellar systems under conservative assumptions about interstellar spacecraft velocities and launch rates. We then consider the question of the galactic steady-state achieved in terms of the fraction of settled planets. We do this by considering the effect of finite settlement civilization lifetimes on the steady states. We find a range of parameters for which the galaxy supports a population of interstellar space-faring civilizations even though some settleable systems are uninhabited. Both results point to ways in which Earth might remain unvisited in the midst of an inhabited galaxy. Finally we consider how our results can be combined with the finite horizon for evidence of previous settlements in Earth's geologic record. Our steady-state model can constrain the probabilities for an Earth visit by a settling civilization before a given time horizon. These results break the link between Hart's famous "Fact A" (no interstellar visitors on Earth now) and the conclusion that humans must, therefore, be the only technological civilization in the galaxy.},

We propose here a classification scheme that distinguishes exoplanets into different categories based on their size and incident stellar flux, for the purpose of providing the expected number of exoplanets observed (yield) with direct imaging missions. The boundaries of this classification can be computed using the known chemical behavior of gases and condensates at different pressures and temperatures in a planetary atmosphere. In this study, we initially focus on condensation curves for sphalerite ZnS, H2O, CO2 and CH4. The order in which these species condense in a planetary atmosphere define the boundaries between different classes of planets. Broadly, the planets are divided into rocky (0.5 - 1.0RE), super-Earths (1.0- 1.75RE), sub-Neptunes (1.75-3.5RE), sub-Jovians (3.5 - 6.0RE) and Jovians (6-14.3RE) based on their planet sizes, and 'hot', 'warm' and 'cold' based on the incident stellar flux.

abstract = {The Wide Field Infrared Survey Telescope (WFIRST) Coronagraphic Instrument (CGI) technology demonstration and potential science mission, as well as mission concepts with exoplanet imaging capabilities such as HabEx and LUVOIR, all require the identification of the best targets for exoplanet observations. To date, the focus has been primarily on two classes of targets: those with known exoplanets discovered indirectly that may be observable by these imaging missions, and those targets with no known planets that have high completeness values (probabilities of planet detections) under some assumptions of the instrument performance and the overall population of exoplanets. A third class of target, however, has received much less scrutiny: stars with known exoplanets that could not possibly be directly imaged due to the size of their orbits. These are planets that would be guaranteed to spend all of their time inside the inner working angles or outside the outer working angles of all currently proposed coronagraphs. However, these systems could potentially harbor additional planets, either exterior to or interior to the currently known planets, but not yet detectable by indirect means. Here, we discuss how to identify systems from all three categories that would be good targets for WFIRST and other, future, space-based imagers. We present a method for assessing the utility of these targets based on an exploration of the available dynamical phase space of the systems that would result in long-term stable orbits for both the currently known and the potentially discoverable companions, and show how it augments existing methods for assessing target completeness and utility.},

abstract = {Several small dense exoplanets are now known, inviting comparisons to Earth and Venus. Such comparisons require translating their masses and sizes to composition models of evolved multi-layer-interior planets. Such theoretical models rely on our understanding of the Earth's interior, as well as independently derived equations of state (EOS), but have so far not involved direct extrapolations from Earth's seismic model -PREM. In order to facilitate more detailed compositional comparisons between small exoplanets and the Earth, we derive here a semi-empirical mass-radius relation for two-layer rocky planets based on PREM: {\$}{\{}\backslashfrac{\{}R{\}}{\{}R{\_}\backslashoplus{\}}{\}} = (1.07-0.21\backslashcdot \backslashtext{\{}CMF{\}})\backslashcdot (\backslashfrac{\{}M{\}}{\{}M{\_}\backslashoplus{\}}){\^{}}{\{}1/3.7{\}}{\$}, where CMF stands for Core Mass Fraction. It is applicable to 1{\$}\backslashsim{\$}8 M{\$}{\_}{\{}\backslashoplus{\}}{\$} and CMF of 0.0{\$}\backslashsim{\$}0.4. Applying this formula to Earth and Venus and several known small exoplanets with radii and masses measured to better than {\$}\backslashsim{\$}30$\backslash${\%} precision gives a CMF fit of {\$}0.26\backslashpm0.07{\$}.},

abstract = {We report a method that uses "completeness" to estimate the number of exrasolar planets discovered by an observing program with a direct-imaging instrument. We develop a completeness function for Earth-like planets on "habitable" orbits for an instrument with a central field obscuration, uniform sensitivity in an annular detection zone, and limiting sensitivity that is expressed as a "delta magnitude" with respect to the star, determined by systematic effects (given adequate exposure time). We demonstrate our method of estimation by applying it to our understanding of the coronagraphic version of the Terrestrial Planet Finder (TPF-C) mission as of October 2004. We establish an initial relationship between the size, quality, and stability of the instrument's optics and its ability to meet mission science requirements. We provide options for increasing the fidelity and versatility of the models on which our method is based, and we discuss how the method could be extended to model the TPF-C mission as a whole, to verify that its design can meet the science requirements.},

abstract = {Mycotoxins are small (MW approximately 700), toxic chemical products formed as secondary metabolites by a few fungal species that readily colonise crops and contaminate them with toxins in the field or after harvest. Ochratoxins and Aflatoxins are mycotoxins of major significance and hence there has been significant research on broad range of analytical and detection techniques that could be useful and practical. Due to the variety of structures of these toxins, it is impossible to use one standard technique for analysis and/or detection. Practical requirements for high-sensitivity analysis and the need for a specialist laboratory setting create challenges for routine analysis. Several existing analytical techniques, which offer flexible and broad-based methods of analysis and in some cases detection, have been discussed in this manuscript. There are a number of methods used, of which many are lab-based, but to our knowledge there seems to be no single technique that stands out above the rest, although analytical liquid chromatography, commonly linked with mass spectroscopy is likely to be popular. This review manuscript discusses (a) sample pre-treatment methods such as liquid-liquid extraction (LLE), supercritical fluid extraction (SFE), solid phase extraction (SPE), (b) separation methods such as (TLC), high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), gas chromatography (GC), and capillary electrophoresis (CE) and (c) others such as ELISA. Further currents trends, advantages and disadvantages and future prospects of these methods have been discussed.},

abstract = {Changes in J2, resulting from past and present changes in Earth's climate, are traditionally observed by Satellite Laser ranging (SLR). Assuming an elastic Earth, it is possible to infer changes in J2 from changes in Earth's shape observed by GPS. We compare estimates of non-secular J2 changes from GPS, SLR, GRACE, and a load model. The GPS and SLR annual signals agree but are different (16{\%}) to the load model. Subtraction of the load model removes the annual variation from GPS, SLR, and GRACE, and the semi-annual variation in GPS. The GPS and SLR long-term signals are highly correlated, but GPS is better correlated with the loading model. Subtraction of the load model removes the 1998 anomaly from the GPS J2 series but not completely from the SLR J2 series, suggesting that the SLR anomaly may not be entirely due to mass re-distribution as has been presumed.},

@article{Errico2013,
abstract = {Abstract Initial design and validation of baseline Observing System Simulation Experiments (OSSEs) at NASA's Global Modeling and Assimilation Office (GMAO) are described. The OSSEs mimic the procedures used to analyze global observations for specifying states of the atmosphere. As simulations, however, OSSEs are not only confined to already existing observations and they provide a perfect description of the true state being analyzed. These two properties of the simulations can be exploited to improve both existing and envisioned observing systems and the algorithms to analyze them. Preliminary to any applications, however, the OSSE framework must be adequately validated. This first version of the simulated observations is drawn from a 13 month simulation of nature produced by the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts. These observations include simulated errors of both instruments and representativeness. Since the statistics of analysis and forecast errors are partially determined by these observational errors, their appropriate modelling can be crucial for validating the realism of the OSSE. That validation is performed by comparing the statistics of the results of assimilating these simulated observations for one summer month compared with the corresponding statistics obtained from assimilating real observations during the same time of year. The assimilation system is the three-dimensional variational analysis (GSI) scheme used at both the National Centers for Environmental Prediction and GMAO. Here, only statistics concerning observation innovations or analysis increments within the troposphere are considered for the validation. In terms of the examined statistics, the OSSE is validated remarkably well, even with some simplifications currently employed. In order to obtain this degree of success, it was necessary to employ horizontally correlated observation errors for both atmospheric motion vectors and some satellite observed radiances. The simulated observations with added observation errors appear suitable for some initial OSSE applications.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 SPIE. While new, advanced, ground-based instrumentation continues to produce new exoplanet discoveries and provide further insights into exoplanet formation and evolution, our desire to discover and characterize planets of Earth size about stars of all types and ages necessitates dedicated, imaging space instruments. Given the high costs and complexities of space observatories, it is vital to build confidence in a proposed instrument's capabilities during its design phase, and much effort has been devoted to predicting the performance of various flavors of space- based exoplanet imagers. The fundamental problem with trying to answer the question of how many exoplanets a given instrument will discover is that the number of discoverable planets is unknown, and so all results are entirely dependent on the assumptions made about the population of planets being studied. Here, we explore an alternate approach, which involves explicitly separating instrumental and mission biasing from the assumptions made about planet distributions. This allows us to calculate a mission's {\^{a}}depth of search'-A metric independent of the planetary population and defined as the fraction of the contrast-projected separation space reached by a given instrument for a fixed planetary radius and semi-major axis. When multiplied by an assumed occurrence rate for planets at this radius and semi-major axis (derived from an assumed planetary population), this yields the expected number of detections by the instrument for that population. Integrating over the full ranges of semi-major axis and planetary radius provides estimates of planet yield for a full mission. We use this metric to evaluate the coronagraphs under development for the WFIRST mission under different operating assumptions. We also compare the results of convolving the depth of search with an assumed planetary population to those derived by running full mission simulations based on that same population.},

abstract = {Model Predictive Control (MPC) is unusual in receiving on-going interest in both industrial and academic circles. Issues such as plant optimization and constrained control which are critical to industrial engineers are naturally embedded in its designs. Model Predictive Control System Design and Implementation Using MATLAB{\textregistered} proposes methods for design and implementation of MPC systems using basis functions that confer the following advantages: • continuous- and discrete-time MPC problems solved in similar design frameworks; • a parsimonious parametric representation of the control trajectory gives rise to computationally efficient algorithms and better on-line performance; and • a more general discrete-time representation of MPC design that becomes identical to the traditional approach for an appropriate choice of parameters. After the theoretical presentation, detailed coverage is given to three industrial applications: a food extruder, a motor and a magnetic bearing system. The subject of quadratic programming, often associated with the core optimization algorithms of MPC is also introduced and explained. The technical contents of this book, mainly based on advances in MPC using state-space models and basis functions – to which the author is a major contributor, will be of interest to control researchers and practitioners, especially of process control. From a pedagogical standpoint, this volume includes numerous simple analytical examples and every chapter contains problems and MATLAB{\textregistered} programs and exercises to assist the student.},

abstract = {Model verification and validation (V{\&}V) is an enabling methodology for the development of computational models that can be used to make engineering predictions with quantified confidence. Model V{\&}V procedures are needed by government and industry to reduce the time, cost, and risk associated with full-scale test ing of products, materials, and weapon systems. Quantifying the confidence and predictive accuracy of model calculations provides the decision-maker with the information necessary for making high-consequence decisions. The development of guidelines and procedures for conducting a model V{\&}V program are currently being defined by a broad spectrum of researchers. This report reviews the concepts involved in such a program. Model V{\&}V is a current topic of great interest to both government and industry. In response to a ban on the production of new strategic weapons and nuclear testing, the Department of Energy (DOE) initiated the Science- Based Stockpile Stewardship Program (SSP). An objective of the SSP is to maintain a high level of confidence in the safety, reliability, and performance of the existing nuclear weapons stockpile in the absence of nuclear testing. This objective has challenged the national laboratories to develop high-confidence tools and methods that can be used to provide credible models needed for stockpile certification via numerical simulation. There has been a significant increase in activity recent ly to define V{\&}V methods and procedures. The U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) Modeling and Simulation Office (DMSO) is working to develop fundamental concepts and terminology for V{\&}V applied to high-level systems such as ballistic missile defense and battle management simulations. The American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) has recently formed a Standards Committee for the development of V{\&}V procedures for computational solid mechanics models. The Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board (DNFSB) has been a proponent of model V{\&}V for all safety-related nuclear facility design, analyses, and operations. In fact, DNFSB 2002-1 1 recommends to the DOE and National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) that a V{\&}V process be performed for all safety related software and analysis. Model verification and validation are the primary processes for quantifying and building credibility in numerical models. Verification is the process of determining that a model implementation accurately represents the developer's conceptual description of the model and its solution. Validation is the process of determining the degree to which a model is an accurate representation of the real world from the perspective of the intended uses of the model. Both verification and validation are processes that accumulat e evidence of a model's correctness or accuracy for a specific scenario; thus, V{\&}V cannot prove that a model is co rrect and accurate for all possible scenarios, but, rather, it can provide evidence that the model is sufficiently accurate for its intended use. vi Model V{\&}V is fundamentally different from software V{\&}V. Code developers developing computer programs perform software V{\&}V to ensure code correctness, reliability, and robustness. In model V{\&}V, the end product is a predictive model based on fundamental physics of the problem being solved. In all applications of practical interest, the calculations involved in obtaining solutions with the mode l require a computer code, e.g., finite element or finite difference analysis. Therefore, engineers seeking to devel op credible predictive models critically need model V{\&}V guidelines and procedures. The expected outcome of the model V{\&} V process is the quantified level of agreement between experimental data and model prediction, as well as the predictive accuracy of the model. This report attempts to describe the general philosophy, definitions, concepts, and processes for conducting a successful V{\&}V program. This objective is motivated by the need for highly accurate numerical models for making predictions to support the SSP, and also by the lack of guidelines, standards and procedures for performing V{\&}V for complex numerical models.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 COPYRIGHT SPIE. Downloading of the abstract is permitted for personal use only. EXOSIMS is an open-source simulation tool for parametric modeling of the detection yield and characterization of exoplanets. EXOSIMS has been adopted by the Exoplanet Exploration Programs Standards Definition and Evaluation Team (ExSDET) as a common mechanism for comparison of exoplanet mission concept studies. To ensure trustworthiness of the tool, we developed a validation test plan that leverages the Python-language unit-test framework, utilizes integration tests for selected module interactions, and performs end-to-end crossvalidation with other yield tools. This paper presents the test methods and results, with the physics-based tests such as photometry and integration time calculation treated in detail and the functional tests treated summarily. The test case utilized a 4m unobscured telescope with an idealized coronagraph and an exoplanet population from the IPAC radial velocity (RV) exoplanet catalog. The known RV planets were set at quadrature to allow deterministic validation of the calculation of physical parameters, such as working angle, photon counts and integration time. The observing keepout region was tested by generating plots and movies of the targets and the keepout zone over a year. Although the keepout integration test required the interpretation of a user, the test revealed problems in the L2 halo orbit and the parameterization of keepout applied to some solar system bodies, which the development team was able to address. The validation testing of EXOSIMS was performed iteratively with the developers of EXOSIMS and resulted in a more robust, stable, and trustworthy tool that the exoplanet community can use to simulate exoplanet direct-detection missions from probe class, to WFIRST, up to large mission concepts such as HabEx and LUVOIR.},

abstract = {We analyze 8 years of precise radial velocity measurements from the Keck Planet Search, characterizing the detection threshold, selection effects, and completeness of the survey. We carry out a systematic search for planets by assessing the false alarm probability associated with Keplerian orbit fits to the data. This allows us to understand the detection threshold for each star in terms of the number and time baseline of the observations, and size of measurement errors and stellar jitter. We show that all planets with orbital periods {\textless}2000 days, velocity amplitudes {\textgreater}20 m/s, and eccentricities {\textless}0.6 have been announced, and summarize the candidates at lower amplitudes and longer orbital periods. For the remaining stars, we calculate upper limits on the velocity amplitude of a companion, typically 10 m/s, and use the non-detections to derive completeness corrections at low amplitudes and long orbital periods. We give the fraction of stars with a planet as a function of planet mass and orbital period, and extrapolate to long period orbits and low planet masses. A power law fit for planet masses {\textgreater}0.3 Jupiter masses and periods {\textless}2000 days gives a mass-period distribution dN=C M{\^{}}$\backslash$alpha P{\^{}}$\backslash$beta dlnM dlnP with $\backslash$alpha=-0.31 $\backslash$pm 0.2, $\backslash$beta=0.26$\backslash$pm 0.1, and the normalization constant C such that 10.5{\%} of solar type stars have a planet with mass in the range 0.3-10 Jupiter masses and orbital period 2-2000 days. The orbital period distribution shows an increase in the planet fraction by a factor of 5 for orbital periods beyond 300 days. Extrapolation gives 17-20{\%} of stars having gas giant planets within 20 AU. Finally, taking into account differences in detectability, we find that M dwarfs are 3 to 10 times less likely to harbor a Jupiter mass planet than solar type stars.},

abstract = {We report 18 years of Doppler shift measurements of a nearby star, 55 Cancri, that exhibits strong evidence for five orbiting planets. The four previously reported planets are strongly confirmed here. A fifth planet is presented, with an apparent orbital period of 260 days, placing it 0.78 AU from the star in the large empty zone between two other planets. The velocity wobble amplitude of 4.9 m s-1 implies a minimum planet mass Msini=45.7 M⊕. The orbital eccentricity is consistent with a circular orbit, but modest eccentricity solutions give similar $\chi$2$\nu$ fits. All five planets reside in low-eccentricity orbits, four having eccentricities under 0.1. The outermost planet orbits 5.8 AU from the star and has a minimum mass Msini=3.8 MJup, making it more massive than the inner four planets combined. Its orbital distance is the largest for an exoplanet with a well-defined orbit. The innermost planet has a semimajor axis of only 0.038 AU and has a minimum mass, Msini, of only 10.8 M⊕, making it one of the lowest mass exoplanets known. The five known planets within 6 AU define a minimum-mass protoplanetary nebula to compare with the classical minimum-mass solar nebula. Numerical N-body simulations show this system of five planets to be dynamically stable and show that the planets with periods of 14.65 and 44.3 days are not in a mean motion resonance. Millimagnitude photometry during 11 years reveals no brightness variations at any of the radial velocity periods, providing support for their interpretation as planetary.

abstract = {This report describes the 2014 study by the Science Definition Team (SDT) of the Wide-Field Infrared Survey Telescope (WFIRST) mission. It is a space observatory that will address the most compelling scientific problems in dark energy, exoplanets and general astrophysics using a 2.4-m telescope with a wide-field infrared instrument and an optical coronagraph. The Astro2010 Decadal Survey recommended a Wide Field Infrared Survey Telescope as its top priority for a new large space mission. As conceived by the decadal survey, WFIRST would carry out a dark energy science program, a microlensing program to determine the demographics of exoplanets, and a general observing program utilizing its ultra wide field. In October 2012, NASA chartered a Science Definition Team (SDT) to produce, in collaboration with the WFIRST Study Office at GSFC and the Program Office at JPL, a Design Reference Mission (DRM) for an implementation of WFIRST using one of the 2.4-m, Hubble-quality telescope assemblies recently made available to NASA. This DRM builds on the work of the earlier WFIRST SDT, reported by Green et al. (2012) and the previous WFIRST-2.4 DRM, reported by Spergel et. (2013). The 2.4-m primary mirror enables a mission with greater sensitivity and higher angular resolution than the 1.3-m and 1.1-m designs considered previously, increasing both the science return of the primary surveys and the capabilities of WFIRST as a Guest Observer facility. The addition of an on-axis coronagraphic instrument to the baseline design enables imaging and spectroscopic studies of planets around nearby stars.},

abstract = {The Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm was developed in the early 1960's to solve ne onlinear least squares problems. Least squares problems arise in the context of fitting a parameterized function to a set of measured data points by minimizing the sum of the squares of the errors between the data points and the function. If the fit function is not linear in the parameters the least squares problem is nonlinear. Nonlinear least squares methods iteratively reduce the sum of the squares of the errors between the function and the measured data points through a sequence of updates to parameter values. The Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm combines two minimization methods: the gradient descent method and the Gauss-Newton method. In the gradient descent method, the sum of the squared errors is reduced by updating the parameters in the steepest-descent direction. In the Gauss-Newton method, the sum of the squared errors is reduced by assuming the least squares function is locally quadratic, and finding the minimum of the quadratic. The Levenberg-Marquardt method acts more like a gradient-descent method when the parameters are far from their optimal value, and acts more like the Gauss-Newton method when the parameters are close to their optimal value. This document describes these methods and illustrates the use of software to solve nonlinear least squares curve-fitting problems.},

abstract = {We present an algorithm, effective over a broad range of planet populations and instruments, for optimizing integration times of an exoplanet direct imaging observation schedule, to maximize the number of unique exoplanet detections under realistic mission constraints. Our planning process uses “completeness” as a reward metric and the nonlinear combination of optimal integration time per target and constant overhead time per target as a cost metric constrained by a total mission time. We validate our planned target list and integration times for a specific telescope by running a Monte Carlo of full mission simulations using EXOSIMS, a code base for simulating telescope survey missions. These simulations encapsulate dynamic details such as time-varying local zodiacal light for each star, planet keep-out regions, exoplanet positions, and strict enforcement of observatory use over time. We test our methods on the Wide-Field Infrared Survey Telescope (WFIRST) coronagraphic instrument (CGI). We find that planet, Sun, and solar panel keep-out regions limit some target per-annum visibility to {\textless}28 {\%} and that the mean local zodiacal light flux for optimally scheduled observations is 22.79 mag arcsec − 2. Both these values are more pessimistic than previous approximations and impact the simulated mission yield. We find that the WFIRST CGI detects 5.48 ± 0.17 and 16.26 ± 0.51 exoplanets, on average, when observing two different planet populations based on Kepler Q1-Q6 data and the full Kepler data release, respectively. Optimizing our planned observations using completeness derived from the more pessimistic planet population (in terms of overall planet occurrence rates) results in a more robust yield than optimization based on the more optimistic planet population. We also find optimization based on the more pessimistic population results in more small planet detections than optimization with the more optimistic population.},

Life on Earth, through its gaseous products and reflectance and scattering properties, has left its fingerprint on the spectrum of our planet. Aided by the universality of the laws of physics and chemistry, we turn to Earth's biosphere, both in the present and through geologic time, for analog signatures that will aid in the search for life elsewhere. Considering the insights gained from modern and ancient Earth, and the broader array of hypothetical exoplanet possibilities, we have compiled a comprehensive overview of our current understanding of potential exoplanet biosignatures, including gaseous, surface, and temporal biosignatures. We additionally survey biogenic spectral features that are well known in the specialist literature but have not yet been robustly vetted in the context of exoplanet biosignatures. We briefly review advances in assessing biosignature plausibility, including novel methods for determining chemical disequilibrium from remotely obtainable data and assessment tools for determining the minimum biomass required to maintain short-lived biogenic gases as atmospheric signatures. We focus particularly on advances made since the seminal review by Des Marais et al. The purpose of this work is not to propose new biosignature strategies, a goal left to companion articles in this series, but to review the current literature, draw meaningful connections between seemingly disparate areas, and clear the way for a path forward.},

abstract = {EarthFinder is a NASA Astrophysics Probe mission concept selected for study as input to the 2020 Astrophysics National Academies Decadal Survey. The EarthFinder concept is based on a dramatic shift in our understanding of how PRV measurements should be made. We propose a new paradigm which brings the high precision, high cadence domain of transit photometry as demonstrated by Kepler and TESS to the challenges of PRV measurements at the cm/s level. This new paradigm takes advantage of: 1) broad wavelength coverage from the UV to NIR which is only possible from space to minimize the effects of stellar activity; 2) extremely compact, highly stable, highly efficient spectrometers (R{\textgreater}150,000) which require the diffraction-limited imaging possible only from space over a broad wavelength range; 3) the revolution in laser-based wavelength standards to ensure cm/s precision over many years; 4) a high cadence observing program which minimizes sampling-induced period aliases; 5) exploiting the absolute flux stability from space for continuum normalization for unprecedented line-by-line analysis not possible from the ground; and 6) focusing on the bright stars which will be the targets of future imaging missions so that EarthFinder can use a {\~{}}1.5 m telescope.},

abstract = {The standard method for solving least squares problems which lead to non-linear normal equations depends upon a reduction of the residuals to linear form by first order Taylor approximations taken about an initial or trial solution for the parameters .2 If the usual least squares procedure, performed with these linear approximations , yields new values for the parameters which are not sufficiently close to the initial values, the neglect of second and higher order terms may invalidate the process, and may actually give rise to a larger value of the sum of the squares of the residuals than that corresponding to the initial solution. This failure of the standard method to improve the initial solution has received some notice in statistical applications of least squares3 and has been encountered rather frequently in connection with certain engineering applications involving the approximate representation of one function by another. The purpose of this article is to show how the problem may be solved by an extension of the standard method which insures improvement of the initial solution.4 The process can also be used for solving non-linear simultaneous equations, in which case it may be considered an extension of Newton's method. Let the function to be approximated be h{\{}x, y, z, • • •), and let the approximating function be H{\{}oc, y, z, • • ■ ; a, j3, y, ■ • ■), where a, /3, 7, • ■ ■ are the unknown parameters. Then the residuals at the points, yit zit • • •), i = 1, 2, ■ • • , n, are /,•(«, /3, 7, • • •) = H(xi, yit zit • • • ; a, /3, y, ■ • •)-h(xit yit z,-, • • •), (1) and the least squares criterion requires the minimization of n s(a, 0, 7. and Sci.

With more than 3,500 exoplanets now known, the complexity of the discovery techniques, observations and physical characterisation have grown exponentially. This Handbook ties all these avenues of research together across a broad range of exoplanet science. Planet formation, exoplanet interiors and atmospheres, and habitability are discussed, providing in-depth coverage of our knowledge to date. Comprehensively updated from the first edition, it includes instrumental and observational developments, in-depth treatment of the new Kepler mission results and hot Jupiter atmospheric studies, and major updates on models of exoplanet formation. With extensive references to the research literature and appendices covering all individual exoplanet discoveries, it is a valuable reference to this exciting field for both incoming and established researchers.},

abstract = {Rigorously quantifying the information in high contrast imaging data is important for informing follow-up strategies to confirm the substellar nature of a point source, constraining theoretical models of planet-disk interactions, and deriving planet occurrence rates. However, within the exoplanet direct imaging community, non-detections have almost exclusively been defined using a frequentist detection threshold (i.e. contrast curve) and associated completeness. This can lead to conceptual inconsistencies when included in a Bayesian framework. A Bayesian upper limit is such that the true value of a parameter lies below this limit with a certain probability. The associated probability is the integral of the posterior distribution with the upper limit as the upper bound. In summary, a frequentist upper limit is a statement about the detectability of planets while a Bayesian upper limit is a statement about the probability of a parameter to lie in an interval given the data. The latter is therefore better suited for rejecting hypotheses or theoretical models based on their predictions. In this work we emphasize that Bayesian statistics and upper limits are more easily interpreted and typically more constraining than the frequentist approach. We illustrate the use of Bayesian analysis in two different cases: 1) with a known planet location where we also propose to use model comparison to constrain the astrophysical nature of the point source and 2) gap-carving planets in TW Hya. To finish, we also mention the problem of combining radial velocity and direct imaging observations.},

Near-term space- and ground- based facilities like $\backslash$emph{\{}WFIRST{\}} and ELTs will be able to directly image mature Jovian planets in reflected light, a critical step in support of future facilities that aim to directly image terrestrial planets in reflected light (e.g. HabEx, LUVOIR).

Here, we investigate the intricacies of using colors to classify gas-giant planets by analyzing a grid of 9,120 theoretical reflected light spectra spread across different metallicities, pressure-temperature profiles, cloud properties, and phase angles. We determine how correlated these planet parameters are with the colors in the $\backslash$emph{\{}WFIRST{\}} photometric bins and other photometric bins proposed in the literature.

abstract = {Different analytical models have been evaluated for estimating wind speed of the tropical storm, where the storm-induced wind velocity is calculated as a function of distance from the center of the hurricane. For these models, different parameters such as maximum wind speed, a radius of the maximum wind, hurricane shape parameter, hurricane translation speed and the orientation of the trajectory, etc., affect the shape of a hurricane. Hurricanes Lili (2002), Ivan (2004), Katrina (2005), Gustav (2008) and Ike (2008) from the Gulf of Mexico were used for skill assessment. The maximum wind radius was calculated using significant wind radii (R34, R50 and R64) reported by the National Hurricane Center. Different formulas for calculating the radius of maximum wind speed were evaluated. The asymmetric wind field for each hurricane was generated using analytic methods and compared with in situ data from buoys in the Gulf of Mexico and the H*Wind data. Analytical models were able to predict high wind speed under tropical cyclone conditions with relatively high precision. Among the analytical models evaluated in this research, the model proposed by Holland et al. (2010) showed excellent results. Dynamical wind models such as NCEP/NARR provide wind speed with the coarse spatial resolution which is acceptable for far-field locations away from the hurricane eye. In contrast, analytical models were able to produce sufficiently reliable wind speed within a particular radius from the center of the hurricane. Therefore blending of dynamical and analytical models can be used to provide accurate wind data during hurricane passage in the Gulf of Mexico.},

Here we present estimates of how many exoplanets the TESS mission will detect, physical properties of the detected planets, and the properties of the stars that those planets orbit. This work uses stars drawn from the TESS Input Catalog Candidate Target List and revises yields from prior studies that were based on Galactic models. We modeled the TESS observing strategy to select approximately 200,000 stars at 2-minute cadence, while the remaining stars are observed at 30-min cadence in full-frame image data. We placed zero or more planets in orbit around each star, with physical properties following measured exoplanet occurrence rates, and used the TESS noise model to predict the derived properties of the detected exoplanets. In the TESS 2-minute cadence mode we estimate that TESS will find 1250+/-70 exoplanets (90{\%} confidence), including 250 smaller than 2 Earth-radii. Furthermore, we predict an additional 3100 planets will be found in full-frame image data orbiting bright dwarf stars and more than 10,000 around fainter stars. We predict that TESS will find 500 planets orbiting M-dwarfs, but the majority of planets will orbit stars larger than the Sun. Our simulated sample of planets contains hundreds of small planets amenable to radial velocity follow-up, potentially more than tripling the number of planets smaller than 4 Earth-radii with mass measurements. This sample of simulated planets is available for use in planning follow-up observations and analyses.},

Here, we derive giant planets occurrence rates as a function of orbital period by taking into account the detection efficiency of the Kepler and radial velocity (RV) surveys. The giant planet occurrence rates for Kepler and RV show the same rising trend with increasing distance from the star. We identify a break in the RV giant planet distribution between {\~{}}2-3 au -- close to the location of the snow line in the Solar System -- after which the occurrence rate decreases with distance from the star. Extrapolating a broken power-law distribution to larger semi-major axes, we find good agreement with the {\~{}} 1{\%} planet occurrence rates from direct imaging surveys. Assuming a symmetric power law, we also estimate that the occurrence of giant planets between 0.1-100 au is 26.6 +7.5 -5.4{\%} for planets with masses 0.1-20MJ and decreases to 6.2 +1.5 -1.2{\%} for planets more massive than Jupiter. This implies that only a fraction of the structures detected in disks around young stars can be attributed to giant planets. Various planet population synthesis models show good agreement with the observed distribution, and we show how a quantitative comparison between model and data can be used to constrain planet formation and migration mechanisms.},

We demonstrate the validity of code we have developed from the California Planet Survey code via comparison with the pulsar timing package, TEMPO2. We estimate the magnitude of various terms and effects, including relativistic effects, and the errors associated with incomplete knowledge of telescope position, timing, and stellar position and motion. We note that chromatic aberration will create uncertainties in the time of observation, which will complicate efforts to detect true Earth analogs. Our code is available for public use and validation.},

abstract = {This book provides an introduction to the basic principles and tools for the design and analysis of feedback systems. It is intended to serve a diverse audience of scientists and engineers who are interested in understanding and utilizing feedback in physical, biological, information and social systems.We have attempted to keep the mathematical prerequisites to a minimum while being careful not to sacrifice rigor in the process. We have also attempted to make use of examples from a variety of disciplines, illustrating the generality of many of the tools while at the same time showing how they can be applied in specific application domains. A major goal of this book is to present a concise and insightful view of the current knowledge in feedback and control systems. The field of control started by teaching everything that was known at the time and, as new knowledge was acquired, additional courses were developed to cover new techniques. A consequence of this evolution is that introductory courses have remained the same for many years, and it is often necessary to take many individual courses in order to obtain a good perspective on the field. In developing this book, we have attempted to condense the current knowledge by emphasizing fundamental concepts. We believe that it is important to understand why feedback is useful, to know the language and basic mathematics of control and to grasp the key paradigms that have been developed over the past half century. It is also important to be able to solve simple feedback problems using back-of-the-envelope techniques, to recognize fundamental limitations and difficult control problems and to have a feel for available design methods. This book was originally developed for use in an experimental course at Caltech involving students from a wide set of backgrounds. The course was offered to undergraduates at the junior and senior levels in traditional engineering disciplines, as well as first- and second-year graduate students in engineering and science. This latter group included graduate students in biology, computer science and physics. Over the course of several years, the text has been classroom tested at Caltech and at Lund University, and the feedback from many students and colleagues has been incorporated to help improve the readability and accessibility of the material. Because of its intended audience, this book is organized in a slightly unusual fashion compared to many other books on feedback and control. In particular, we introduce a number of concepts in the text that are normally reserved for second-year courses on control and hence often not available to students who are not control systems majors. This has been done at the expense of certain traditional topics, which we felt that the astute student could learn independently and are often explored through the exercises. Examples of topics that we have included are nonlinear dynamics, Lyapunov stability analysis, the matrix exponential, reachability and observability, and fundamental limits of performance and robustness. Topics that we have deemphasized include root locus techniques, lead/lag compensation and detailed rules for generating Bode and Nyquist plots by hand. Several features of the book are designed to facilitate its dual function as a basic engineering text and as an introduction for researchers in natural, information and social sciences. The bulk of the material is intended to be used regardless of the audience and covers the core principles and tools in the analysis and design of feedback systems. Advanced sections, marked by the {\^{a}}€{\oe}dangerous bend{\^{a}}€� symbol shown here, contain material that requires a slightly more technical background, of the sort that would be expected of senior undergraduates in engineering. A few sections are marked by two dangerous bend symbols and are intended for readers with more specialized backgrounds, identified at the beginning of the section. To limit the length of the text, several standard results and extensions are given in the exercises, with appropriate hints toward their solutions. To further augment the printed material contained here, a companion web site has been developed and is available from the publisher{\^{a}}€™s web page: http://press.princeton.edu/titles/8701.html The web site contains a database of frequently asked questions, supplemental examples and exercises, and lecture material for courses based on this text. The material is organized by chapter and includes a summary of the major points in the text as well as links to external resources. The web site also contains the source code for many examples in the book, as well as utilities to implement the techniques described in the text. Most of the code was originally written using MATLAB M-files but was also tested with LabView MathScript to ensure compatibility with both packages. Many files can also be run using other scripting languages such as Octave, SciLab, SysQuake and Xmath. The first half of the book focuses almost exclusively on state space control systems. We begin in Chapter 2 with a description of modeling of physical, biological and information systems using ordinary differential equations and difference equations. Chapter 3 presents a number of examples in some detail, primarily as a reference for problems that will be used throughout the text. Following this, Chapter 4 looks at the dynamic behavior of models, including definitions of stability and more complicated nonlinear behavior. We provide advanced sections in this chapter on Lyapunov stability analysis because we find that it is useful in a broad array of applications and is frequently a topic that is not introduced until later in one{\^{a}}€™s studies. The remaining three chapters of the first half of the book focus on linear systems, beginning with a description of input/output behavior in Chapter 5. In Chapter 6, we formally introduce feedback systems by demonstrating how state space control laws can be designed. This is followed in Chapter 7 by material on output feedback and estimators. Chapters 6 and 7 introduce the key concepts of reachability and observability, which give tremendous insight into the choice of actuators and sensors, whether for engineered or natural systems. The second half of the book presents material that is often considered to be from the field of {\^{a}}€{\oe}classical control.{\^{a}}€� This includes the transfer function, introduced in Chapter 8, which is a fundamental tool for understanding feedback systems. Using transfer functions, one can begin to analyze the stability of feedback systems using frequency domain analysis, including the ability to reason about the closed loop behavior of a system from its open loop characteristics. This is the subject of Chapter 9, which revolves around the Nyquist stability criterion. In Chapters 10 and 11, we again look at the design problem, focusing first on proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controllers and then on the more general process of loop shaping. PID control is by far the most common design technique in control systems and a useful tool for any student. The chapter on frequency domain design introduces many of the ideas of modern control theory, including the sensitivity function. In Chapter 12, we combine the results from the second half of the book to analyze some of the fundamental trade-offs between robustness and performance. This is also a key chapter illustrating the power of the techniques that have been developed and serving as an introduction for more advanced studies. The book is designed for use in a 10- to 15-week course in feedback systems that provides many of the key concepts needed in a variety of disciplines. For a 10-week course, Chapters 1{\^{a}}€“2, 4{\^{a}}€“6 and 8{\^{a}}€“11 can each be covered in a week{\^{a}}€™s time, with the omission of some topics from the final chapters. A more leisurely course, spread out over 14{\^{a}}€“15 weeks, could cover the entire book, with 2 weeks on modeling (Chapters 2 and 3) {\^{a}}€” particularly for students without much background in ordinary differential equations {\^{a}}€” and 2 weeks on robust performance (Chapter 12). The mathematical prerequisites for the book are modest and in keeping with our goal of providing an introduction that serves a broad audience. We assume familiarity with the basic tools of linear algebra, including matrices, vectors and eigenvalues. These are typically covered in a sophomore-level course on the subject, and the textbooks by Apostol [10], Arnold [13] and Strang [187] can serve as good references. Similarly, we assume basic knowledge of differential equations, including the concepts of homogeneous and particular solutions for linear ordinary differential equations in one variable. Apostol [10] and Boyce and DiPrima [42] cover this material well. Finally, we also make use of complex numbers and functions and, in some of the advanced sections, more detailed concepts in complex variables that are typically covered in a junior-level engineering or physics course in mathematical methods. Apostol [9] or Stewart [186] can be used for the basic material, with Ahlfors [6], Marsden and Hoffman [146] or Saff and Snider [172] being good references for the more advanced material. We have chosen not to include appendices summarizing these various topics since there are a number of good books available. One additional choice that we felt was important was the decision not to rely on a knowledge of Laplace transforms in the book. While their use is by far the most common approach to teaching feedback systems in engineering, many students in the natural and information sciences may lack the necessary mathematical background. Since Laplace transforms are not required in any essential way, we have included them only in an advanced section intended to tie things together for students with that background. Of course, we make tremendous use of transfer functions, which we introduce through the notion of response to exponential inputs,},

The transition probability density function is approximated by a finite sum of Gaussian density functions for which the parameters (mean and covariance) are propagated using linear propagation theory. Two different approaches are introduced to update the weights of different components of a Gaussian-mixture model for uncertainty propagation through nonlinear system. The first method updates the weights such that they minimize the integral square difference between the true forecast probability density function and its Gaussian-sum approximation. The second method uses the Fokker-Planck-Kolmogorov equation error as feedback to adapt for the amplitude of different Gaussian components while solving a quadratic programming problem. The proposed methods are applied to a variety of problems in the open literature and are argued to be an excellent candidate for higher-dimensional uncertainty-propagation problems.},

abstract = {The HabEx and LUVOIR mission concepts reported science yields for mission scenarios in which the instruments must search for potentially habitable planets, determine their orbits, and, if worthwhile, invest the integration time for a spectral characterization. We evaluate the impact of prior knowledge of planet existence and orbital parameters on yield for four mission concept architectures: HabEx 4m telescope with hybrid starshade and coronagraph, HabEx 4m telescope with starshade only, HabEx 4m telescope with coronagraph only, and LUVOIR B 8m telescope with coronagraph only. We use perfect prior knowledge to establish an upper bound on yield and use partial prior knowledge from a potential future extreme precision radial velocity (EPRV) instrument with 3 cm / s sensitivity. We detail a modeling framework that performs dynamically responsive observation scheduling with realistic mission constraints. We evaluate exo-Earth yields against three metrics of spectral characterization for the four mission architectures and three levels of prior knowledge (none, partial, and perfect). The EPRV provided prior knowledge increases yields by ∼30 {\%} and accelerates by a factor of 3 to 6 the time to achieve half of the yield of the mission. Prior knowledge makes all the mission architectures more nimble and powerful, and most especially starshade-based architectures. With prior knowledge, a small telescope with a starshade can achieve comparable yield to a larger telescope with a coronagraph.},

abstract = {The Second Workshop on Extreme Precision Radial Velocities defined circa 2015 the state of the art Doppler precision and identified the critical path challenges for reaching 10 cm/s measurement precision. The presentations and discussion of key issues for instrumentation and data analysis and the workshop recommendations for achieving this precision are summarized here. Beginning with the HARPS spectrograph, technological advances for precision radial velocity measurements have focused on building extremely stable instruments. To reach still higher precision, future spectrometers will need to produce even higher fidelity spectra. This should be possible with improved environmental control, greater stability in the illumination of the spectrometer optics, better detectors, more precise wavelength calibration, and broader bandwidth spectra. Key data analysis challenges for the precision radial velocity community include distinguishing center of mass Keplerian motion from photospheric velocities, and the proper treatment of telluric contamination. Success here is coupled to the instrument design, but also requires the implementation of robust statistical and modeling techniques. Center of mass velocities produce Doppler shifts that affect every line identically, while photospheric velocities produce line profile asymmetries with wavelength and temporal dependencies that are different from Keplerian signals. Exoplanets are an important subfield of astronomy and there has been an impressive rate of discovery over the past two decades. Higher precision radial velocity measurements are required to serve as a discovery technique for potentially habitable worlds and to characterize detections from transit missions. The future of exoplanet science has very different trajectories depending on the precision that can ultimately be achieved with Doppler measurements.},

Here, we discuss and compare two fundamental approaches to mission analysis, full mission simulation and depth of search analysis, in the specific context of simulating and comparing multiple different mission concepts.

abstract = {A probabilistic description is essential for understanding growth processes far from equilibrium. In this paper, we compute time-dependent Probability Density Functions (PDFs) in order to investigate stochastic logistic and Gompertz models, which are two of the most popular growth models. We consider different types of short-correlated internal (multiplicative) and external (additive) stochastic noises and compare the time-dependent PDFs in the two models, elucidating the effects of the additive and multiplicative noises on the form of PDFs. We demonstrate an interesting transition from a unimodal to a bimodal PDF as the multiplicative noise increases for a fixed value of the additive noise. A much weaker (leaky) attractor in the Gompertz model leads to a significant (singular) growth of the population of a very small size. We point out the limitation of using stationary PDFs, mean value and variance in understanding statistical properties of the growth far from equilibrium, highlighting the importance of time-dependent PDFs. We further compare these two models from the perspective of information change that occurs during the growth process. Specifically, we define an infinitesimal distance at any time by comparing two PDFs at times infinitesimally apart and sum these distances in time. The total distance along the trajectory quantifies the total number of different states that the system undergoes in time, and is called the information length. We show that the time-evolution of the two models become more similar when measured in units of the information length and point out the merit of using the information length in unifying and understanding the dynamic evolution of different growth processes.},

Here we estimate exoEarth candidate yield using single visit completeness for a variety of mission design and astrophysical parameters.

We introduce a method, called Altruistic Yield Optimization, that optimizes the target list and exposure times to maximize mission yield, adapts maximally to changes in mission parameters, and increases exoEarth candidate yield by up to 100{\%} compared to previous methods. We use Altruistic Yield Optimization to estimate exoEarth candidate yield for a large suite of mission and astrophysical parameters using single visit completeness. We find that exoEarth candidate yield is most sensitive to telescope diameter, followed by coronagraph inner working angle, followed by coronagraph contrast, and finally coronagraph contrast noise floor. We find a surprisingly weak dependence of exoEarth candidate yield on exozodi level. Additionally, we provide a quantitative approach to defining a yield goal for future exoEarth-imaging missions.},

These detections allowed the study of the planet populations in the first 5-8AU from the central stars and have provided precious information on the way planets form and evolve at such separations. Direct imaging on 8-10m class telescopes allows the detection of giant planets at larger separations (currently typically more than 5- 10 AU) complementing the indirect techniques. So far, only a few planets have been imaged around young stars, but each of them provides an opportunity for unique dedicated studies of their orbital, physical and atmospheric properties and sometimes also on the interaction with the 'second-generation', debris discs. These few detections already challenge formation theories. In this paper, I present the results of direct imaging surveys obtained so far, and what they already tell us about giant planet (GP) formation and evolution. Individual and emblematic cases are detailed; they illustrate what future instruments will routinely deliver for a much larger number of stars. I also point out the limitations of this approach, as well as the needs for further work in terms of planet formation modelling.

abstract = {The sensitivity of radial velocity (RV) surveys for exoplanet detection are extending to increasingly long orbital periods, where companions with periods of several years are now being regularly discovered. Companions with orbital periods that exceed the duration of the survey manifest in the data as an incomplete orbit or linear trend, a feature that can either present as the sole detectable companion to the host star, or as an additional signal overlain on the signatures of previously discovered companion(s). A diagnostic that can confirm or constrain scenarios in which the trend is caused by an unseen stellar, rather than planetary, companion is the use of high-contrast imaging observations. Here, we present RV data from the Anglo-Australian Planet Search (AAPS) for twenty stars that show evidence of orbiting companions. Of these, six companions have resolved orbits, with three that lie in the planetary regime. Two of these (HD{\~{}}92987b and HD{\~{}}221420b) are new discoveries. Follow-up observations using the Differential Speckle Survey Instrument (DSSI) on the Gemini South telescope revealed that five of the twenty monitored companions are likely stellar in nature. We use the sensitivity of the AAPS and DSSI data to place constraints on the mass of the companions for the remaining systems. Our analysis shows that a planetary-mass companion provides the most likely self-consistent explanation of the data for many of the remaining systems.},

abstract = {We describe work in progress by a collaboration of astronomers and statisticians developing a suite of Bayesian data analysis tools for extrasolar planet (exoplanet) detection, planetary orbit estimation, and adaptive scheduling of observations. Our work addresses analysis of stellar reflex motion data, where a planet is detected by observing the "wobble" of its host star as it responds to the gravitational tug of the orbiting planet. Newtonian mechanics specifies an analytical model for the resulting time series, but it is strongly nonlinear, yielding complex, multimodal likelihood functions; it is even more complex when multiple planets are present. The number of dimensions in the model parameter space ranges from a few to dozens, depending on the number of planets in the system, and the type of motion measured (line-of-sight velocity, or position on the sky). Since orbits are periodic, Bayesian generalizations of periodogram methods facilitate the analysis. This relies on the model being linearly separable, enabling partial analytical marginalization, reducing the dimension of the parameter space. Subsequent analysis uses adaptive Markov chain Monte Carlo methods and adaptive importance sampling to perform the integrals required for both inference (planet detection and orbit measurement), and information-maximizing sequential design (for adaptive scheduling of observations). We present an overview of our current techniques and highlight directions being explored by ongoing research. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V..},

abstract = {Starting with just the assumption of uniformly distributed orbital orientations, we derive expressions for the distributions of the Keplerian orbital elements as functions of arbitrary distributions of eccentricity and semimajor axis. We present methods for finding the probability density functions of the true anomaly, eccentric anomaly, orbital radius, and other parameters used in describing direct planetary observations. We also demonstrate the independence of the distribution of phase angle, which is highly significant in the study of direct searches, and present examples validating the derived expressions. {\textcopyright} 2011.

abstract = {RadVel is an open-source Python package for modeling Keplerian orbits in radial velocity (RV) timeseries. RadVel provides a convenient framework to fit RVs using maximum a posteriori optimization and to compute robust confidence intervals by sampling the posterior probability density via Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). RadVel allows users to float or fix parameters, impose priors, and perform Bayesian model comparison. We have implemented real-time MCMC convergence tests to ensure adequate sampling of the posterior. RadVel can output a number of publication-quality plots and tables. Users may interface with RadVel through a convenient command-line interface or directly from Python. The code is object-oriented and thus naturally extensible. We encourage contributions from the community.},

@article{Murray1980b,
abstract = {In a naive approach to the theory of dynamical systems on Euclidean space Rn, one might hope to obtain a complete classification of all systems, starting with the very simplest types and gradually building up an understanding of more complicated ones. The difficulties that one encounters, even at the linear stage underline the complexity and richness of the theory of dynamical systems, and this is part of its attraction. They also indicate the need for a less ambitious approach to the whole classification problem. Instead of aiming at a complete solution, this chapter attempts to classify a “suitably large” class of dynamical systems. This chapter begins with a review of linear systems on Rn. The bulk of the chapter, however, deals with stable linear systems on a general Banach space. For this, a certain amount of spectral theory is needed that is included in an appendix to the chapter. The material of Rn provides a background of concrete examples against, which the more general results on Banach spaces may be tested and placed in perspective. {\textcopyright} 1980, Academic Press Inc.},

@article{Huang2018,
abstract = {We present a prediction of the transiting exoplanet yield of the TESS primary mission, in order to guide follow-up observations and science projects utilizing TESS discoveries. Our new simulations differ from previous work by using (1) an updated photometric noise model that accounts for the nominal pointing jitter estimated through simulation prior to launch, (2) improved stellar parameters based on Gaia mission Data Release 2, (3) improved empirically-based simulation of multi-planet systems, (4) a realistic method of selecting targets for 2-minute exposures, and (5) a more realistic geometric distortion model to determine the sky region that falls on TESS CCDs. We also present simulations of the planet yield for three suggested observing strategies of the TESS extended mission. We report {\~{}}{\$}10{\^{}}4{\$} planets to be discovered by the TESS primary mission, as well as an additional {\$}\backslashsim 2000{\$} planets for each year of the three extended mission scenarios we explored. We predict that in the primary mission, TESS will discover about 3500 planets with Neptune size and smaller, half of which will orbit stars with TESS magnitudes brighter than 12. Specifically, we proposed a new extended mission scenario that centers Camera 3 on the ecliptic pole (C3PO), which will yield more long period planets as well as moderately irradiated planets that orbit F, G, and K stars.},

@article{Gao2010a,
abstract = {In this paper, we first prove that the expansion and contraction steps of the Nelder-Mead simplex algorithm possess a descent property when the objective function is uniformly convex. This property provides some new insights on why the standard Nelder-Mead algorithm becomes inefficient in high dimensions. We then propose an implementation of the Nelder-Mead method in which the expansion, contraction, and shrink parameters depend on the dimension of the optimization problem. Our numerical experiments show that the new implementation outperforms the standard Nelder-Mead method for high dimensional problems. {\textcopyright} Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2010.},
